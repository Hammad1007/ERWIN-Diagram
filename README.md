State Life Insurance Divisional Office Database

The Divisional office of the State Life Insurance keeps all the necessary information about the policy
holders in a database. A policy holder (the person who registers for Life insurance) pays a premium until
the maturity of the policy or his death, at which time the sum assured and bonus is paid to the nominee.
The premium to be paid is worked out based on the age of the person proposed and the term of the policy.
State Life division keeps the following information about each policy holder: social security number,
name, address, date of birth, description of the terms of the policy and the annual premium.
The corporation has divided its division into 15 zones for its convenience. Each zone has its manager.
Every zone has a number of agents allotted, typically ranging from 10 to 20. Every agent must procure a
minimum of 10 customers.

Draw an E-R diagram for the Divisional office database (state any assumptions you believe you need to
make in order to develop a complete diagram). Identify the key attribute (attributes) for each entity and
the cardinality of each entity relationship.
